This is an simple Machine Learning Application. It is trained by simple Multi Class Classification method, for training function I have used gradient descent method. Alghoritm is implemented in C++ using Armadillo Library, and is implemented in Assembler. What is interesting I have accelarated alghoritm by about 36\%. Mainly it is obtained by power function written in assembler.
